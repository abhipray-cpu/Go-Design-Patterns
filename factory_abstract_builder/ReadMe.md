# Design Patterns in E-commerce System

This project demonstrates the use of three fundamental creational design patterns in the context of an e-commerce system. By implementing the Factory Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern, and Builder Pattern, we aim to showcase how these patterns can enhance flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in software design.

## Overview

The project is structured around a simple yet comprehensive e-commerce system, focusing on user management, product catalog, and order processing. Each section leverages a specific design pattern to address common software development challenges.

### 1. Factory Pattern: User Management

- **Purpose**: Simplifies the creation of user objects, allowing for easy extension and management.
- **Implementation**: A `UserFactory` class dynamically creates user objects (e.g., `AdminUser`, `RegularUser`) based on input criteria.

### 2. Builder Pattern: Products and Carts

- **Purpose**: Facilitates the construction of complex objects (products and shopping carts) in a step-by-step manner.
- **Implementation**:
  - `ProductBuilder` for assembling product objects with various attributes.
  - `CartBuilder` for creating shopping cart objects, accommodating dynamic addition of products and calculation of totals.

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern: Order Management

- **Purpose**: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Implementation**: An `OrderFactory` interface defines methods for creating order components (`Order`, `ShippingDetails`). Concrete factories (`RegularOrderFactory`, `PremiumOrderFactory`) implement these methods to instantiate order-related objects.

## Getting Started

To explore the design patterns implemented in this project, clone the repository and navigate to the respective directories (`user/`, `product/`, `order/`) to view the source code and examples.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical guide to understanding and applying the Factory, Abstract Factory, and Builder patterns in real-world software development scenarios. By structuring the e-commerce system around these patterns, we demonstrate their effectiveness in achieving a clean, organized, and scalable codebase.
